The data contains information on the year, mileage, engine size, and fuel type of the car, as well as the price at which it was listed.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before conducting the analysis, basic data cleaning was performed, including dropping rows that contained missing values. The necessary libraries were imported for the exploratory data analysis, including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, NumPy, and various machine learning libraries from sci-kit-learn.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Exploratory data analysis was conducted through visualizations, including Fuel Type and Engine Size Comparison Plots, a scatter plot with fuel types mapped to numeric values, and plots to identify the top and least models being sold over the year, as well as comparisons of sales of high mileage and low mileage cars and trends in sales by transmission. The data was also sorted by tax and the top and bottom rows were analyzed, as well as the top 5 models with the highest tax value.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Model selection and training were then performed, evaluating the performance of linear regression, decision tree, and random forest models through mean squared error. The features and target variable were selected, the data was split into training and test sets, and the model was fit to the training data. Predictions of car sales were made for 10 listings from 2021 to 2022.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Results</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The results of the analysis showed that the linear regression model had the lowest mean squared error, indicating that it was the most accurate in predicting car prices based on the given features. The top and least popular models based on the number of sales were identified, with the C Class being the top model and the 230 being the least popular model. The top model and least model being sold over the year, and the year each model sold the most were also identified. The distribution of sales by transmission type was examined, with semi-automatic transmission being the most popular, followed by automatic and manual. The top 5 models with the highest tax value were also identified, with the C Class and G Class being among the top models in 2013 and 2014, respectively.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sales of high-mileage and low-mileage cars were then compared, and it was found that low-mileage cars had higher sales. The top-selling cars by model and year were also identified, with the C Class being the top seller in 2019 and 2017, and the A-Class is the top seller in 2019 and 2017. The lowest-selling cars over the years were then identified, with the M Class in 1970 having the least sales. The medium-selling cars over the years were also identified, with the A-Class, G Class, and E Class among the models with the most sales in 2007, 2018, and 2009, respectively. The year with the highest sales for the top model (E Class) was also identified as 2017.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition, the relationship between fuel type and engine size was examined through the creation of scatter plots. It was found that diesel fuel had the highest average MPG for most engine sizes, while hybrid fuel had the highest average MPG for larger engine sizes. Petrol fuel had the lowest average MPG for most engine sizes.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conclusion</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This report has provided insights into the factors that influence the price of used cars and demonstrated the usefulness of machine learning techniques in analyzing and predicting car prices. In terms of recommendations, it would be beneficial to continue collecting data on used car listings and adding additional features to the dataset. This could potentially improve the accuracy of the machine learning model in predicting car prices. Additionally, it would be interesting to further analyze the effect of fuel type on car price, as this was not included as a feature in the current analysis. It is also worth noting that the analysis was conducted on data from the UK, and it would be interesting to see if similar trends and patterns hold for other countries. Overall, the findings of this report can be useful for individuals looking to buy or sell used Mercedes-Benz cars, as well as for car dealerships and other stakeholders in the automotive industry.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
